## Project Description

This project analyzes the financial data of 370 Polish listed companies (GPW), taking into account sector-specific characteristics, to support investment decision-making. 

The goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts each company's investment level (low, medium, or high) based on key financial indicators.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - raw and labeled datasets (see `data/README.md`), and SQL scripts 
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing and modeling experiments
- `src/` - Python scripts for preprocessing data and training the final ML model
- `reports/` – Power BI dashboards and related analytics outputs
- `CRISP-DM.md` - detailed methodology workflow

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.11
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow (MLP)
- Tools: Power BI, SQL (Data Extraction), Canva (Presentation)
