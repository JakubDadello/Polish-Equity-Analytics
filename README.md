## Project Description

This project analyzes the financial data of 370 Polish listed companies (GPW), taking into account sector-specific characteristics, to support investment decision-making. 

The goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts each company's investment level (low, medium, or high) based on key financial indicators.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` - preprocessing and modeling notebooks
- `src/` - Python scripts for preprocessing data and training the final ML model
- `dashboards/` - Power BI dashboards
- `CRISP-DM.md` - detailed methodology workflow
