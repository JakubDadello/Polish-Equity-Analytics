# Polish-Equity-Analytics

## Project Description

This project analyzes the financial data of 370 Polish listed companies (GPW), taking into account sector-specific characteristics, to support investment decision-making. 

The goal is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts each company's investment rating (low, medium, or high) based on key financial indicators.

## How to Run

To run this project locally, you can use either Docker (recommended) or a standard Python environment.

### Using Docker 
* **Docker Compose:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build

* **Build the image:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t pqa_python_api .
* **Run the container:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name pqa_python_container pqa_python_api

### Using Python (Local Environment)
* **Install requirements:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
* **Launch FastAPI server:**
  ```bash
  uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - raw, labeled and preprocessed datasets (see `data/README.md`)
- `ETL/` - responsible for data extraction, joining financial tables, and initial cleaning before the machine learning phase.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing and modeling experiments
- `src/` - Python scripts for preprocessing data and training the final ML model
- `reports/` – Power BI dashboards and related analytics outputs
- `CRISP-DM.md` - detailed methodology workflow
- `airflow/` – optional workflow automation layer used for scheduling, orchestrating, and automating data processing and model training pipelines.
